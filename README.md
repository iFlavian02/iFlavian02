## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**iFlavian02/iFlavian02** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some infos about me and my programming side of life

I am currently working on developing my skills as i am in final year of highschool
i am looking forward to joining the CS college in Iasi, and then further follow the IT career path
i would like to improve on real life, practical skills, building stuff myself, not just school things
i answer as quickly as i can wherever i am contacted, let it be email, messages or phone

- âš¡ Fun fact: I get really bored in class because i feel it holds me back from improving at my rate
